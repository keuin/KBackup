# About KBackup

KBackup is a simple plugin which allows you to backup your Minecraft server's worlds manually (and automatically maybe in the future).
This project comes out because I find there are no good enough plugins for my tiny 1.14.4 survival server, so I have myself making a new backup plugin.
Base version should be 1.14.4, because that's the version my server is using currently. Multiversion support should be added in future releases.
